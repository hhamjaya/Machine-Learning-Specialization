# [Machine-Learning-Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?#instructors)
The Machine Learning Specialization is a foundational online program created in collaboration between DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online. This Repository Contains Solution to the Assignments of the Machine Learning Specialization from deeplearning.ai on Coursera Taught by [Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/andrewng)

**Disclaimer**

**If you're new to artificial intelligence, you might want to look at the Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera. Use the coding projects in this repository as a help or guide, but don't just copy them if you're taking this course. Copying won't really help you learn. It's better to watch all the lecture videos, do the quizzes, and work on the coding tasks by yourself. They are pretty easy to understand.**

## WHAT YOU WILL LEARN

* Build ML models with NumPy & scikit-learn, build & train supervised models for prediction & binary classification tasks (linear, logistic regression)
* Build & train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification, & build & use decision trees & tree ensemble methods
* Apply best practices for ML development & use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning including clustering & anomaly detection
* Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach & a content-based deep learning method & build a deep reinforcement learning model

## 3 Specialization Courses

### COURSE 1 - Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
In the first course of the Machine Learning Specialization, you will:

* Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.
